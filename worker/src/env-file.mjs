 * Single-key edits to a dotenv-style file, in two disciplines.
 *
 * `setEnvKeyIfEmpty` exists for `pi-dispatch up`, which fills WEBHOOK_SECRET into a scaffolded .env
 * without asking the operator to hand-run `openssl rand -hex 32`. It is init's contract applied to a
 * single key instead of a whole file: init never overwrites an existing file, and this never
 * overwrites an existing VALUE — a key the operator already set is sacrosanct, because a tool that
 * "helpfully" rotates a live webhook secret breaks every configured forge hook at once, silently.
 *
 * `setEnvKey` is the CONSENTED-overwrite sibling, added for `pi-dispatch setup github` (issue #81),
 * whose whole point is replacing values like GITHUB_AUTH_SOURCE=gh with the App credentials the
 * operator just minted and approved line-by-line. The consent lives at the CALLER, never here.
 *
 * Both return the input text UNCHANGED (byte-identical, same object) when there is nothing to do, so
 * callers can compare identity to know nothing happened.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free (node:fs only, and only in the thin wrapper): it must stay importable
 * from any future setup command without dragging worker config or queue deps along.
