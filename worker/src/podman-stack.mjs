/**
 * The native rootless `podman` venue's long-lived stack as Quadlet units (issue #430): Valkey, and while the egress
 * policy is armed the allowlist proxy on its named route-out network. ONE installer, used by both
 * `pi-dispatch service install` (user scope) and `pi-dispatch up`, on up.mjs's own doctrine that two ways of starting
 * one thing is two places for it to drift.
 *
 * Quadlet rather than `podman run --restart`: rootless Podman has no daemon to restart anything, so a container
 * started by hand is gone after a reboot. `podman-restart.service` could bring back `--restart=always` containers,
 * but it is a unit the operator would have to enable separately and it orders nothing; a Quadlet unit is a real
 * systemd user unit the worker's own unit can `Wants=`/`After=`. Measured on Fedora 44 with Podman 5.8.1:
 *   - `NetworkName=` and `ContainerName=` give exactly those names (no `systemd-` prefix), and `Network=X.network`
 *     resolves through the network file's `NetworkName=`.
 *   - `systemctl --user enable` REFUSES a generated unit ("transient or generated"); the generator reads the
 *     file's own `[Install] WantedBy=default.target` instead. So install is: write the files, daemon-reload,
 *     `systemctl --user start`. Never enable.
 *   - With linger on, the units were active 25 s after a reboot with nobody logged in; with linger off they did
 *     not start at all. Hence the linger read after every install.
 *   - `systemctl --user restart` of the proxy creates a NEW container (`--replace --rm`), and every per-job network
 *     the worker had connected to the old one is gone. New jobs connect at their start and are fine; see docs.
 *
 * This module decides and describes; it spawns only through the `run` seam it is handed and writes only through the
 * `fs` seam, so `service` and `up` each keep their own spawn helpers and their own tests' fakes.
